## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm, pnpm, or bun

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the following variables:

```env
# Public site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Supabase (Server-side only — used for lead capture)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

> **Note**: In development, if Supabase credentials are not provided, lead submissions will safely log to the server console as a fallback instead of throwing an error.

### 4. Database Setup (Supabase)

To enable lead capture storage:

1. Create a project in [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
2. Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard.
3. Run the SQL script located at [`supabase/leads.sql`](supabase/leads.sql).
4. Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled with no public read/write access. Only the server-side service role key can insert records.

### 5. Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.
